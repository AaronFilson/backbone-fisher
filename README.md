# backbone-fisher
A backbone CRUD client for bears and salmons.

### backbone overview
The basic elements of a backbone app are:
 * Models
 * Collections
 * Views
 * Routers

At a high level, the backbone Models are a data-binding object to let the server talk to the client in an intelligent way.

Collections are groupings of models, and methods to act on those models.

Views are the client facing elements of backbone, and render the information to the user and take their inputs.

Routers map addresses to functions and collections (or models), and provide history and URL behaviors that users benefit from.
